1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
   I made the program using Java since I have been using it since high school. 
   I know other languages, but Java is the one I use most of the time

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
   Advantage:
   1.  I have created 3 classes for this program.
       1. Main class is the one to start the program, read input, manage other objects
       2. PointManager is the class to manage user's points
       3. PayerData is the class for payer point records

   2.  PointManager is using a TreeMap that keeps all payer's data in order sorted by timestamp. 
       It takes O(logN) to add new payer data.

   3.  I converted timeStamp from string to long because comparing long types should be faster.

   Disadvantage:
   1.  C++ might be faster than JAVA since JAVA is running a virtual machine, that causes some overhead
   
3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
   One project that has stood out as my favorite so far is my zombie shooter game. It's a personal 
   project that I created using JavaFX and mathematics, and I've enjoyed slowly building upon it 
   over time. This project has provided me with a sandbox to experiment with different zombie behaviors 
   and bullet mechanics, allowing me to immerse myself in recreating my favorite genre of flash games. 
   However, I did face a challenge when it came to remembering and organizing the code, which I 
   overcame by leaving detailed comments and focusing on maintaining organization from the outset 
   for future projects.
